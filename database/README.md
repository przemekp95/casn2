# Database Directory

Contains database-related files and migrations for the CASN Laravel application.

## Description

This directory holds database migrations, seeders, and factories. Note that this application primarily uses static content routing rather than database-driven content.

## Structure

- `migrations/` - Database schema migrations
- `seeders/` - Database seeders for initial data
- `factories/` - Model factories for testing

## Getting Started

Since this application uses static content, database migrations are minimal and mainly handle basic Laravel functionality.
