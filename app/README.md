# App Directory

Contains the core application code for the CASN Laravel project.

## Description

This directory holds the main application logic including controllers, services, and other PHP classes.

## Structure

- `Http/Controllers/` - Web controllers handling HTTP requests
- `Services/` - Business logic services
- `Providers/` - Service providers for application bootstrapping

## Getting Started

The application uses a hybrid approach with static content and service-based architecture. Controllers use services to access data instead of direct database queries.
