# Storage Directory

Contains application storage files for the CASN Laravel application.

## Description

This directory holds application-generated files including logs, cache, sessions, and uploaded files.

## Structure

- `app/` - Application-specific storage files
- `framework/` - Laravel framework files (cache, views, sessions)
- `logs/` - Application log files
- `pail/` - Pail log viewer files

## Getting Started

The storage directory should be writable by the web server. Laravel uses this directory for caching, logging, and file storage.
